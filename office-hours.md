title: CS 4400 - Office Hours
---

My office hours at GTL are the first three class days of the week in my GTL office, Room 101. I assume people travel on the last class day of the week (as I sometimes will too) and I schedule all assignment due dates for the second or third class day of the week.

- 12:30 - 13:30: I'll be in my office with door open for drop-ins.
- 14:30 - 15:30: I like to attend a French class during this time but I'm available for office hours by appointment. Please feel free to email if you'd like to see me during this time.
- 15:30 - 16:30: When the class schedule lists "Extended office hours" I'll be in my office with door open for drop-ins and stay unitl the last student leaves, but will assume no one (else) is coming if I have no students at 16:30 and no emails asking for later meeting times.

Any time my door is open, feel free to stop in. If you'd like to see me outside of the hours listed above, please feel free to send me an email.
