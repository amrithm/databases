* Advanced SQL

** NULL

The special value ~NULL~ could mean:

- Unknown
- Unavailable
- Not Applicable

** Three-Valued Logic - AND


AND     | TRUE    | FALSE   | UNKNOWN |
--------|---------|---------|---------|
TRUE    | TRUE    | FALSE   | UNKNOWN |
FALSE   | FALSE   | FALSE   | FALSE   |
UNKNOWN | UNKNOWN | FALSE   | UNKNOWN |

** Three-Valued Logic - OR

OR      | TRUE    | FALSE   | UNKNOWN  |
--------|---------|---------|----------|
TRUE    | TRUE    | TRUE    | TRUE     |
FALSE   | TRUE    | FALSE   | UNKKNOWN |
UNKNOWN | TRUE    | UNKNOWN | UNKNOWN  |

** Three-Valued Logic - NOT

NOT     | TRUE    |
--------|---------|
TRUE    | FALSE   |
FALSE   | TRUE    |
UNKNOWN | UNKNOWN |

** Comparisons with NULL Values

Each ~NULL~ is distinct, so comparisons with $<$, $>$, and $=$ don't make sense.

To compare with null, use SQL operator ~IS~, e.g., "Which books don't have editors?":

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
SELECT * FROM book WHERE editor IS NULL;
#+END_SRC

Inner joins include only tuples for which the join condition evaluates to TRUE.

** Queries in Depth

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
SELECT [DISTINCT] <select_header> FROM <source_tables>
WHERE <filter_expression>
GROUP BY <grouping_expressions>
HAVING <filter_expression>
ORDER BY <ordering_expressions>
LIMIT <count> OFFSET <count>
#+END_SRC

- The table is the fundamental data abstraction in a relational
database.
- The select command returns its result as a table
- Think of a select statement as creating a pipeline, each stage of which produces an intermediate working table

** The SELECT Pipeline

The evaluation order of select clauses is approximately:

1. ~FROM <source_tables>~ - Designates one or more source tables and
combines them together into one large working table.
2. ~WHERE <filter_expression>~ - Filters specific rows of working table
3. ~GROUP BY <grouping_expressions>~ - Groups sets of rows in the working table based on similar values
4. ~SELECT <select_heading>~ - Defines the result set columns and (if applicable) grouping aggregates.
5. ~HAVING <filter_expression>~ - Filters specific rows of the grouped table. Requires a GROUP BY
6. ~DISTINCT~ - Eliminates duplicate rows.
7. ~ORDER BY <ordering_expressions> - Sorts the rows of the result set
8. ~OFFSET <count>~ - Skips over rows at the beginning of the result set. Requires a LIMIT.
9. ~LIMIT <count>~ - Limits the result set output to a specific number of rows.

** SELECT Pipeline at a Glance

1. ~FROM <source_tables>~
2. ~WHERE <filter_expression>~
3. ~GROUP BY <grouping_expressions>~
4. ~SELECT <select_heading>~
5. ~HAVING <filter_expression>~
6. ~DISTINCT~
7. ~ORDER BY <ordering_expressions>~
8. ~OFFSET <count>~
9. ~LIMIT <count>~

Evaluation order determines what can be cross referenced in clauses.

** Aggregate Functions

Operate on groups of rows. Some common ones: ~COUNT~, ~SUM~, ~AVG~

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
mysql> select count(*) from book;
+----------+
| count(*) |
+----------+
|        8 |
+----------+
#+END_SRC

There are 8 rows in the ~book~ table.

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
mysql> select count(editor) from book;
+---------------+
| count(editor) |
+---------------+
|             6 |
+---------------+
#+END_SRC

Notice that ~COUNT~ doesn't count ~NULL~ values.

** ~GROUP BY~

The ~GROUP BY~ clause groups rows in the working table by the values in the specified column(s) and collapses each group into a single row.

- We can apply an aggregate function to the resulting groups
- If we donâ€™t apply an aggregate function, only the last row of a group is returned.
    - Since rows within groups are in no particular order, failing to apply an aggregate function would essentially give us a random result.

** Aggregate Functions on Groups

Aggregate functions apply some function the to the rows grouped together by a ~GROUP BY~ clause.

How many papers did each author write?

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
mysql> select author_id, last_name, count(author_id)
    -> from author join author_pub using (author_id)
    ->   join pub using (pub_id)
    -> group by author_id;
+-----------+-----------+------------------+
| author_id | last_name | count(author_id) |
+-----------+-----------+------------------+
|         1 | McCarthy  |                1 |
|         2 | Ritchie   |                1 |
|         3 | Thompson  |                1 |
|         4 | Shannon   |                1 |
|         5 | Turing    |                2 |
|         6 | Church    |                1 |
+-----------+-----------+------------------+
#+END_SRC

Aggregate function is applied to column in ~GROUP BY~.

** Sorting, Aliasing, and Limiting

Who wrote the most publications?

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
mysql> select author_id, last_name, count(author_id) as pub_count
    -> from author join author_pub using (author_id) join pub using (pub_id)
    -> group by author_id
    -> order by pub_count desc;
+-----------+-----------+-----------+
| author_id | last_name | pub_count |
+-----------+-----------+-----------+
|         5 | Turing    |         2 |
|         1 | McCarthy  |         1 |
|         2 | Ritchie   |         1 |
|         6 | Church    |         1 |
|         3 | Thompson  |         1 |
|         4 | Shannon   |         1 |
+-----------+-----------+-----------+
6 rows in set (0.00 sec)
#+END_SRC

Notice that we also used an alias so we could reference the count in the ~ORDER BY~ clause

** Limiting Results

If we want only the answer from the last query we can use ~LIMIT~:

Who wrote the most publications?

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
mysql> select author_id, last_name, count(author_id) as pub_count
    -> from author join author_pub using (author_id) join pub using (pub_id)
    -> group by author_id
    -> order by pub_count desc
    -> limit 1;
+-----------+-----------+-----------+
| author_id | last_name | pub_count |
+-----------+-----------+-----------+
|         5 | Turing    |         2 |
+-----------+-----------+-----------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
#+END_SRC

** ~HAVING~

In the previous query we got the top author by pub count. If we want all authors having a particular pub count, we can use a ~HAVING~ clause.

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
mysql> select author_id, last_name, count(author_id) as pub_count
    -> from author join author_pub using (author_id)
    ->   join pub using (pub_id)
    -> group by author_id
    -> having pub_count = 1;
+-----------+-----------+-----------+
| Author_id | last_name | pub_count |
+-----------+-----------+-----------+
|         1 | McCarthy  |         1 |
|         2 | Ritchie   |         1 |
|         3 | Thompson  |         1 |
|         4 | Shannon   |         1 |
|         6 | Church    |         1 |
+-----------+-----------+-----------+
#+END_SRC

We can use comparisons like <, >. Notice that ~Turing~ is not in the result.

** HAVING vs. WHERE Conditions

Functionally HAVING and WHERE do the same thing: they filter-in tuples. The difference is where they are evaluated in the SELECT pipeline.

- WHERE is evaluated only after the FROM clause that selects the source tables, so WHERE clauses can only reference expressions that do not contain aggregate functions
- HAVING is evaluated after GROUP BY, and SELECT, so HAVING clauses can reference any result column

Be aware that rows filtered out by a WHERE clause will not be included in a GROUP BY clause.

** WHERE vs. HAVING Example

~WHERE~ clause can't refer to column aliases and aggregates in the ~SELECT~ list or apply functions to groups greated by ~GROUP BY~ clauses.

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
mysql> select author_id, last_name, count(author_id) as pub_count
    -> from author natural join author_pub natural join pub
    -> where pub_count = 1
    -> group by author_id;
ERROR 1054 (42S22): Unknown column 'pub_count' in 'where clause'
#+END_SRC

HAVING can refer to select columns.

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
mysql> select author_id, last_name, count(author_id) as pub_count
    -> from author natural join author_pub natural join pub
    -> group by author_id
    -> having pub_count = 1;
+-----------+-----------+-----------+
| author_id | last_name | pub_count |
+-----------+-----------+-----------+
|         1 | McCarthy  |         1 |
|         2 | Ritchie   |         1 |
|         3 | Thompson  |         1 |
|         4 | Shannon   |         1 |
|         6 | Church    |         1 |
+-----------+-----------+-----------+
5 rows in set (0.00 sec)
#+END_SRC

** The ~IN~ Operator

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
mysql> select * from book where month in ('April', 'July');
+---------+------------+-------+------+--------+
| book_id | book_title | month | year | editor |
+---------+------------+-------+------+--------+
|       1 | CACM       | April | 1960 |      8 |
|       2 | CACM       | July  | 1974 |      8 |
|       3 | BST        | July  | 1948 |      2 |
|       7 | AAAI       | July  | 2012 |      9 |
|       8 | NIPS       | July  | 2012 |      9 |
+---------+------------+-------+------+--------+
5 rows in set (0.00 sec)
#+END_SRC

** Nested Queries, a.k.a., Sub-Selects

List all the books published in the same month in which an issue of CACM was published.

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
mysql> select book_title, month
    -> from book
    -> where month in (select month
    ->                 from book
                       where book_title = 'CACM');
+------------+-------+
| book_title | month |
+------------+-------+
| CACM       | April |
| CACM       | July  |
| BST        | July  |
| AAAI       | July  |
| NIPS       | July  |
+------------+-------+
5 rows in set (0.00 sec)
#+END_SRC

** Simple Summation

Here are the data in the ~dorm~ table:

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
mysql> select * from dorm;
+---------+-----------+--------+
| dorm_id | name      | spaces |
+---------+-----------+--------+
|       1 | Armstrong |    124 |
|       2 | Brown     |    158 |
|       3 | Caldwell  |    158 |
+---------+-----------+--------+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)
#+END_SRC

What is the total capacity (number of spaces) for all dorms?

** SUM

To find the total capacity for all dorms, sum the ~spaces~ column:

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
mysql> select sum(spaces) from dorm;
+-------------+
| sum(spaces) |
+-------------+
|         440 |
+-------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
#+END_SRC

Or use a column alias in the select list to make output clearer:

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
mysql> select sum(spaces) as total_capacity from dorm;
+----------------+
| total_capacity |
+----------------+
|            440 |
+----------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
#+END_SRC

** Grouping and Counting

What is the occupancy of each dorm?

First, get a feel for the data:

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
mysql> select * from dorm join student using (dorm_id) order by dorm.name;
+---------+-----------+--------+------------+--------+------+
| dorm_id | name      | spaces | student_id | name   | gpa  |
+---------+-----------+--------+------------+--------+------+
|       1 | Armstrong |    124 |          1 | Alice  | 3.60 |
|       1 | Armstrong |    124 |          2 | Bob    | 2.70 |
|       1 | Armstrong |    124 |          3 | Cheng  | 3.90 |
|       2 | Brown     |    158 |          4 | Dhruv  | 3.40 |
|       2 | Brown     |    158 |          5 | Ellie  | 4.00 |
|       2 | Brown     |    158 |          6 | Fong   | 2.30 |
|       3 | Caldwell  |    158 |          7 | Gerd   | 4.00 |
|       3 | Caldwell  |    158 |          8 | Hal    | 2.20 |
|       3 | Caldwell  |    158 |          9 | Isaac  | 2.00 |
|       3 | Caldwell  |    158 |         10 | Jacque | 4.00 |
+---------+-----------+--------+------------+--------+------+
#+END_SRC
We can see that there are three groups of dorms in the result, which we could group by ~dorm_id~ or ~dorm.name~.

** Dorm Occupancy

So we group by ~dorm.name~ and count the rows in each group.

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
mysql> select dorm.name as dorm_name, count(*) as occupancy
    -> from dorm join student using (dorm_id)
    -> group by dorm.name;
+-----------+-----------+
| dorm_name | occupancy |
+-----------+-----------+
| Armstrong |         3 |
| Brown     |         3 |
| Caldwell  |         4 |
+-----------+-----------+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)
#+END_SRC

** Ordering

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
mysql> select dorm.name as dorm_name, count(*) as occupancy
    -> from dorm join student using (dorm_id)
    -> group by dorm.name
    -> order by occupancy desc;
+-----------+-----------+
| dorm_name | occupancy |
+-----------+-----------+
| Caldwell  |         4 |
| Armstrong |         3 |
| Brown     |         3 |
+-----------+-----------+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)
#+END_SRC

** Nested Queries

Which dorms have fewer occupants than Caldwell?

Step 1: how many occupants in Caldwell?

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
mysql> select count(*) as caldwell_occupancy
    -> from dorm join student using(dorm_id)
    -> where dorm.name = 'caldwell';
+--------------------+
| caldwell_occupancy |
+--------------------+
|                  4 |
+--------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
#+END_SRC

** Occupancy Less than Caldwell

Now we use the previous "caldwell_occupancy" query as a subquery.

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
mysql> select dorm.name as dorm_name, count(*) as occupancy
    -> from dorm join student using (dorm_id)
    -> group by dorm_name
    -> having occupancy < (select count(*) as caldwell_occupancy
    ->                     from dorm join student using(dorm_id)
    ->                     where dorm.name = 'caldwell');
+-----------+-----------+
| dorm_name | occupancy |
+-----------+-----------+
| Armstrong |         3 |
| Brown     |         3 |
+-----------+-----------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
#+END_SRC

Notice that we couldn't use a where clause here because occupancy is computed from a group, which isn't available at the ~WHERE~ stage of the SQL ~SELECT~ pipeline.

** Extended Example: Which dorm has the highest average GPA?

- Step 1: Group students and their GPAs by dorm.
- Step 2: Get the average GPAs of each dorm.
- Step 3: Get the max avg GPA from step 2.

** Step 1: Group students and their GPAs by dorm

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
mysql> select dorm.name as dorm_name, student.name as student_name, gpa
    -> from dorm join student using (dorm_id)
    -> group by dorm_name, student_name, gpa;
+-----------+--------------+------+
| dorm_name | student_name | gpa  |
+-----------+--------------+------+
| Armstrong | Alice        |  3.6 |
| Armstrong | Bob          |  2.7 |
| Armstrong | Cheng        |  3.9 |
| Brown     | Dhruv        |  3.4 |
| Brown     | Ellie        |    4 |
| Brown     | Fong         |  2.3 |
| Caldwell  | Gerd         |    4 |
| Caldwell  | Hal          |  2.2 |
| Caldwell  | Isaac        |    2 |
| Caldwell  | Jacque       |    5 |
+-----------+--------------+------+
10 rows in set (0.00 sec)
#+END_SRC

** Step 2: Get the average GPAs of each dorm.

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
mysql> select dorm.name as dorm_name, avg(gpa) as average_gpa
    -> from dorm join student using (dorm_id)
    -> group by dorm_name;
+-----------+--------------------+
| dorm_name | average_gpa        |
+-----------+--------------------+
| Armstrong |  3.400000015894572 |
| Brown     | 3.2333333492279053 |
| Caldwell  |  3.300000011920929 |
+-----------+--------------------+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)
#+END_SRC

** Step 2.1 Formatting Numeric Values

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
mysql> select dorm.name as dorm_name, format(avg(gpa), 2) as average_gpa
    -> from dorm join student using (dorm_id)
    -> group by dorm_name;
+-----------+-------------+
| dorm_name | average_gpa |
+-----------+-------------+
| Armstrong | 3.40        |
| Brown     | 3.23        |
| Caldwell  | 3.30        |
+-----------+-------------+
3 rows in set (0.01 sec)
#+END_SRC

** ~FORMAT(x,d[,locale])~

- Formats the number ~x~ to ~d~ decimals using a format like 'nn,nnn.nnn' and returns the result as a string. If ~d~ is 0, the result has no decimal point or fractional part.
- ~locale~ defaults to the value of the ~lc_time_names~ system variable.

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
mysql> select @@lc_time_names;
+-----------------+
| @@lc_time_names |
+-----------------+
| en_US           |
+-----------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
#+END_SRC

** Step 3: Get max average gpa from average gpa results.

Using a nested query:

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
mysql> select dorm_name, max(average_gpa) as max_average_gpa
    -> from (select dorm.name as dorm_name, format(avg(gpa), 2) as average_gpa
    ->       from dorm join student using (dorm_id)
    ->       group by dorm_name) as avg_gpas;
+-----------+-----------------+
| dorm_name | max_average_gpa |
+-----------+-----------------+
| Armstrong | 3.40            |
+-----------+-----------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

#+END_SRC

** Views

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
mysql> create view cacm_issues as
    ->   select * from book
