# A database is ...

- a logically coherent collection of data,
- representing some aspect of the world known as a *miniworld* or *universe of discourse*, which is
- created for a specific purpose and group of users.

A database management system (DBMS) allows us to create and maintain databases on a computer.

# Data and Metadata

- Data

    - Records
    - Data elements

- Metadata -- "data about data"

    - Types of data elements
    - Structure of records
    - Constraints

# Database Development

- Requirements analysis
- Conceptual design
- Logical design
- Physical design

# The Database Approach

- Self-describing data - metadata stored with data
- Insulation between data and programs, and data abstraction
- Multiple views of the data
- Shared data and multiuser transaction processing

# Database Users

- Database administrators
- Database designers
- End users
- System analysts and programmers

# Capabilities of a DBMS

- Controlling Redundancy
- Restricting unauthorized access
- Providing persistent storage for data objects
- Providing efficient query processing
- Providing backup and recovery
- Providing multiple user interfaces
- Reperesenting relationships among data
- Enforcing integrity constraints
- Permitting inference and action through rules and triggers

# History of Database Technology

- Hierarchical and network systems
- Relational databases (focus of this course)
- Object-oriented databases
- XML
- New applications: media storage (e.g., video, images), data mining, spatial/GIS, time series
- Big data and NOSQL
