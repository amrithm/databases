* Relational Calculus

** Tuple Relational Calculus

Tuple relational calculus is a declarative retrieval language based on mathematical logic

  - Relational algebra is procedural -- order of operations matters

- Relational algebra and relational calculus have equivalent expressive power

- A query language $L$ is *relationally complete* if one can express in $L$ any query that can be expressed in relational calculus

In this course we cover *tuple relational calculus* which, along with relational algebra, forms the theoretical basis of SQL. Another variant, *domain relational calculus* is the theoretical basis of Query by Example (QBE), which is far less common than SQL.

** Basic Tuple Relational Caclulus Expressions

\[
\{t | COND(t)\}
\]

Where

- $t$ is a tuple variable
- $COND(t)$ is a boolean expression involving $t$

The result of the expression is all tuples $t$ for which $COND(t)$ evaluates to $true$.

** Range Relations

To find all employees whose salary is above \$50,000:

\[
\{t | EMPLOYEE(t) AND t.Salary > 50000\}
\]

- $EMPLOYEE(t)$ is a *range relation*. It ...
