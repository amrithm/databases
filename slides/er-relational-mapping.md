# ER to Relational Mapping

Algorithm

# Step 1: Mapping Regular (Strong) Entity Types

A strong entity type is modeled as a relation schema.

- Each simple attribute of the entity type becomes an attribute of the relation schema
    - For composite attributes, only the simple component attributes are present in the relation schema
- Choose a key of the entity type to be the primary key of the relation schema

A tuple of a relation is an entity instance.

# Step 2: Mapping Weak Entity Types

# Step 3: Mapping Binary 1:1 Relationship Types

# Step 4: Mapping Binary 1:N Relationship Types

# Step 5: Mapping Binary M:N Relationship Types

# Step 6: Mapping Multivalued Attributes

# Step 7: Mapping of N-ary Relationship Types

# Step 8: Mapping Specializations and Generalizations

# Step 9: Mapping Union Types (Categories)
