title: CS 4400 - Peer Evaluation

# Peer Evaluation

At the end of each phase, each team member should send me an email with the subject "CS 4400 Team N Phase M Peer Eval," where N is your team number and M is the project phase. The body of the email should list each team member with a grade adjustment factor in increments of .1 which indicates the proportion of work that team member contributed to the project. If each tem member contributed in equal proportion, each team member would get 1.0. The sum of the project contribution scores for each tem member must be equal to the number of team members. For example, if one team member gets 1.1, some other team mbmber must get 0.9. If any team member gets more than 1.1 or less than 0.9, please include a brief justification.

Here's an example email for a fictitious Team 0, with five members:

```sh
To: chris.simpkins@gatech.edu
From: jchandrasekhar3@gatech.edu
Subject: CS 4400 Team 0 Phase 1 Peer Eval

1. Jay Chandrasekhar: 1.0
2. Kevin Heffernan: 1.2 (Did all UI design and code and was a great Scrum Master)
3. Steve Lemme: 0.9
4. Paul Soter: 0.9
5. Erik Stolhanske 1.0

Total: 5.0
```

If an individual did no work at all, give them a 0.0 and subtract 1.0 from your team's total.

A grade adjustment for a team member will occur only if all other team members concur that that team member should get a grade adjustment. In the above example, if all team members agree that Steve Lemme's project contribution factor is 0.9, then Steve Lemme's final course grade will be the team's overall grade multiplied by 0.9.
