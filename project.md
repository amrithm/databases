# Project

You will design and implement a database application using the MySQL relational database system available via CoC (College of Computing). The Project must be done in groups of 3 - 5 students. Groups of more than 5 or less than 3 will not be allowed. The project will consist of 3 phases (deliverables) as well as a final demonstration to the TA.

## Phase 1

Given a problem specification from (a) fictional user(s), create an EER model of the users' data, a list of semantic constraints that cannot be modeled in EER, and an information flow diagram of a database application suited to the user's problem.

## Phase 2

Map your (corrected) EER model and semantic constraints from Phase 1 to a relational model and write an SQL script with DDL (`create table`) statements that will create the (unpopulated) database in MySQL.

## Phase 3

Given the problem specification and your (corrected) relational database schema from Phase 2, write an SQL script with DML (`insert`) statements to populate the database with data and another SQL script with a set of queries that answer questions provided in the project description.

Heavyweight option: in addition to the items above, create an application that provides an interface to the database for a database user specified in the project desctiption.
